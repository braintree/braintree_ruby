= Braintree Ruby Client Library

The Braintree gem provides integration access to the Braintree Gateway.

== Dependencies

* builder
* libxml-ruby

== Quick Start Example

  require "rubygems"
  require "braintree"

  Braintree::Configuration.environment = :sandbox
  Braintree::Configuration.merchant_id = "your_merchant_id"
  Braintree::Configuration.public_key = "your_public_key"
  Braintree::Configuration.private_key = "your_private_key"

  result = Braintree::Transaction.sale(
    :amount => "1000.00",
    :credit_card => {
      :number => "5105105105105100",
      :expiration_date => "05/12"
    }
  )

  if result.success?
    puts "success!: #{result.transaction.id}"
  elsif result.transaction
    puts "Error processing transaction:"
    puts "  code: #{result.transaction.processor_response_code}"
    puts "  text: #{result.transaction.processor_response_text}"
  else
    p result.errors
  end

== Bang Methods

Most methods have a bang and a non-bang version (e.g. <tt>Braintree::Customer.create</tt> and <tt>Braintree::Customer.create!</tt>).
The non-bang version will either return a +SuccessfulResult+ or an +ErrorResult+. The bang version will either return
the created or updated resource, or it will raise a ValidationsFailed exception.

Example of using non-bang method:

  result = Braintree::Customer.create(:first_name => "Josh")
  if result.success?
    puts "Created customer #{result.customer.id}
  else
    puts "Validations failed"
    result.errors.for(:customer).each do |error|
      puts error.message
    end
  end

Example of using bang method:

  begin
    customer = Braintree::Customer.create!(:first_name => "Josh")
    puts "Created customer #{customer.id}
  rescue Braintree::ValidationsFailed
    puts "Validations failed"
  end

We recommend using the bang methods when you assume that the data is valid and do not expect validations to fail.
Otherwise, we recommend using the non-bang methods.

== Tests

The unit specs can be run by anyone on any system, but the integration specs are meant to be run against a local development
server of our gateway code.  These integration specs are not meant for public consumption and will likely fail if run on
your system.
